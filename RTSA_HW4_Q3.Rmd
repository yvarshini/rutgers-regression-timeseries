This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Loading necessary libraries
library(sp)
library(gstat)
library(car)
library(MASS)
```
```{r}
# Loading the data
data(meuse)
Meusedata = meuse
head(Meusedata)
```
```{r}
# Linear regression: zince vs. elev and dist
myModel <- lm(zinc ~ elev + dist, data = Meusedata)
summary(myModel)
```
```{r}
# Q-Q plot and other plots for the residuals in myModel
plot(myModel)
```
```{r}
# Performing Box-Cox transformation to make the residuals have zero variance
l <- boxcox(myModel)

# Extracting lambda
lambda <- l$x[which.max(l$y)]
lambda

# Transforming the y variable (zinc)
myTransformedModel <- lm((zinc^lambda - 1)/lambda ~ dist + elev, data = Meusedata)
summary(myTransformedModel)
plot(myTransformedModel)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
