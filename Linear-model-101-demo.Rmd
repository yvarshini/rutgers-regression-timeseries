This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("readxl")			#Installing the package
```

```{r}
library(readxl)	
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}


EffcyData = read_excel(file.choose())		#Loading the energy efficiency dataset

head(EffcyData)					#Seeing the first few rows of the data

```

The variables signify the following attributes:
#X1 Relative Compactness
#X2 Surface Area
#X3 Wall Area
#X4 Roof Area
#X5 Overall Height
#X6 Orientation
#X7 Glazing Area
#X8 Glazing Area Distribution
#Y1 Heating Load (response)
#Y2 Cooling Load (response)

Renaming the variables for better understanding

```{r}
names(EffcyData)=c("RelCompact","SurfArea","WallArea","RoofArea","OverallHeight","Orientation","GlazArea","GlazAreaDist","HeatLoad", "CoolLoad")
names(EffcyData)
#attach(data_1)	
```




```{r}
#model_1=lm(Y1 ~ I(2*X1))					#Fitting the model
#summary(model_1)

model_2=lm(HeatLoad ~ RelCompact, data = EffcyData)					#Fitting the model
summary(model_2)
```


#We fit a linear regression model with NO intercept choosing HeatLoad as the response
#and RelCompact as the explanatory variable. 

```{r}

model_2=lm(HeatLoad ~ RelCompact - 1, data = EffcyData)
summary(model_2)
```

We now do a data transformation 

```{r}
					#Transformation of X1
model_4=lm(HeatLoad ~ I(RelCompact^2), data = EffcyData)
summary(model_4)
```

#We fit a multiple linear regression model with intercept choosing Y1 as the response
#and X1,X2 and X3 as the explanatory variables.


```{r}
model_4=lm(HeatLoad ~ RelCompact + SurfArea + WallArea, data = EffcyData)
summary(model_4)
```


No intercept multiple lin model

```{r}
model_4=lm(HeatLoad ~ RelCompact + SurfArea + WallArea - 1, data = EffcyData)

# Note that we add "-1" at the very end. Not at any random place. 

summary(model_4)
```
```{r}

```
